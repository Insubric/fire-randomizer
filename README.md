This MS-Excel<sup>&#169;</sup> sheet contains a macro to assess fire selectivity of geographical or vegetational categories with Monte Carlo simulations.

The macros were implemented by Gianni Boris Pezzatti (boris.pezzatti @ wsl.ch  - Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL) under the statistical supervision of Carlo Ricotta (Department of Plant Biology, University of Rome 'La Sapienza').
